# Panoramas
	
I took panoramas of the two rooms in my house where I do most of my work for class, research, and remote internship duties. I thought it would be cool to visually show the spaces where I live where I feel most comfortable to work from because I know the spaces I chose may be different from person to person. Sadly, the pictures only show part of the story of my study space preferences because my most preferred place to work/study is FML which is not accessible at this point (from what I know). In this way, the panoramas can also be secondarily perceived as a story of adaptation in the midst of the pandemic because the spaces I find most comfortable to work in have been closed down for the time being.
