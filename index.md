# Welcome to Ryder Griffith's Github Page for Comm 165!


Hey folks! My name is Ryder Griffith and I am a rising senior at Lehigh University. 

I am from a town outside of Philadelphia called Media but I am living in Bethlehem this summer. 

Right now I am double majoring in computer science and journalism with a minor in philosophy. 

I am taking this class because data interests me and this class seems to combine ideas from both of the majors I am studying at the moment. 

I like when plans go smoothly and I dislike heartburn.
